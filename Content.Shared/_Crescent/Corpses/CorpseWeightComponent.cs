/// it is ever revived, so the values below are only ever live on an actual corpse.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Bodies used to drift forever. Tile friction is skipped entirely for weightless entities and for
/// anything still in the air from a throw, so a corpse shoved in a corridor - or blown out of one by a
/// shipgun - kept its velocity until it hit something. Physics damping is applied by the solver itself
/// on both client and server, which is why the fix lives here rather than in a per-tick velocity clamp.
///
/// Authoring this component on a mob prototype is optional and only changes the numbers; the system
/// applies its own defaults to every mob that dies without one.
