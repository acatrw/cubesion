# Sword and laurel revision

Five imperial banner variants with ivory-white sword-and-laurel heraldry based
on the user's uploaded reference. Purple cloth, gold trim and the five distinct
banner silhouettes are retained.

Created with the built-in `image_gen` tool. Exact redesign and background
extraction prompts are in `prompts.json`. Each `*-source.png` is the final
full-resolution RGBA artwork. `preview.png` shows final sprites at 6x and native
32x32 sizes. Run `export.ps1` to regenerate the game sprites and preview using
nearest-neighbor sampling and an alpha threshold of 128. Horizontal sampling
is offset by half a destination pixel to keep the thin central blade visible.

Game asset: `Resources/Textures/_Crescent/Structures/imperialflag_improved.rsi`.
States and prototype IDs are unchanged: flag / ImperialFlag, ceremonial /
ImperialFlagCeremonial, swallowtail / ImperialFlagSwallowtail, guard /
ImperialFlagGuard, battleworn / ImperialFlagBattleworn.

RSI metadata, dimensions, transparency and prototype references are checked;
appearance has not been play-tested in the game.
