/// always sums to 100%, so a company can only gain what the others lose — there is no free money in
/// the market as a whole, only reallocation.
///
/// The four faction companies carry no randomness whatsoever: their price moves only when something
/// actually happens in the round (casualties, a station going dark, treasury swings, a won war).
/// Reading the war correctly is the entire skill of trading them. The two neutral companies
/// (<c>fmn</c>, <c>tccc</c>) are the exception — they carry a little noise, pull back toward their
/// opening price, and profit from the chaos the factions generate, so there is always something to
/// hedge into.
///
/// The authoritative per-company state is its <see cref="StockCompanyData.PriceMultiplier"/>, not its
/// share. Share is derived from the multipliers of whichever companies are currently listed. That
/// distinction matters: a mode that fields only two factions delists the other two, and if share were
/// the stored quantity, renormalising the smaller pool would jolt every remaining price at round start
/// for no in-game reason. Storing the multiplier means the roster can change without moving a price.
///
/// Market state survives round restarts (in memory) and server restarts (mirrored to JSON in the
/// server's user-data directory), so a faction that spent three rounds losing starts the fourth cheap.
